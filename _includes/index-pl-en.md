### Programming Languages and IT

I'm interested in programming languages and related technologies as they pertain to
software and systems development, e.g. Haskell ecosystem, Nix and NixOS, (Doom) Emacs and
modal editing (in the spirit of `vi`), Linux and Open Source Software, verified software
and interactive theorem provers (especially, `Coq` and `Agda`). Check out:
