I am interested in typed functional programming and corresponding languages (mostly, Haskell), type and effect systems, mathematics of program construction (if this sounds mysterious, there is one [good list of references][1]). In the past I worked for better software engineering principles of building a computer algebra software in C++, especially using what C++ world knows as _generic programming_. For now I'm mostly working on a principled approach to the Julia programming language. Here are some links to find out more:
