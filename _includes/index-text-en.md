I am interested in typed functional programming and corresponding languages (mostly, Haskell),
type and effect systems, [mathematics of program construction][1]. In the past I worked
towards better software engineering principles of building computer algebra software in C++,
especially using what C++ world knows as _generic programming_. After that, I was working
on a principled approach to the subtyping relation in the Julia programming language
(cf. [our OOPSLA'18 publication][2] on that). Right now, I'm studing Julia's
notion of type stability and its propagation through the package ecosystem.

Here are some links to find out more about my professional interests:

*   [Curriculum Vit√¶ \[PDF\]](cv.pdf)
*   [Papers, talks, etc.](papers.html) (russian only)
*   [Teaching](teaching.en.html)
*   [Projects](projects.en.html)

The links on non-academic works of mine I'm particularly happy about:

* [My contributions to the GHC Haskell compiler][3]

* [Blog post about my internship at Tweag I/O in 2019][4]
