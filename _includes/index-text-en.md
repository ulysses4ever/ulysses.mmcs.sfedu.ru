I am interested in typed functional programming and corresponding languages (mostly, Haskell), type and effect systems, mathematics of program construction (if this sounds mysterious, there is one [good list of references][1]). In the past I worked for better software engineering principles of building a computer algebra software in C++, especially using what C++ world knows as _generic programming_. Lately, I was working on a principled approach to the subtyping relation in the Julia programming language (cf. [OOPSLA'18 publication][2]). Right now, I'm researching a mixture of control-flow (à la Algol and ML) and data-flow (à la Datalog) approaches to programming in a commerical DSL implemented on top of Julia.
